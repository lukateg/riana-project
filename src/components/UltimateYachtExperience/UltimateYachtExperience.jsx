              custom-built 42-meter, 220-ton luxury sailing yacht with the
              elegance & grace of the traditional sailing yachts of yesteryear

            <p>
              Riana Yacht is in the top 30% (by LOA) of all yachts in the world
              and arguably outperforms practically all others in its class &
              size with its combination of cruising speed vs. efficiency vs.
              economy vs. comfort and volume. Exuding quality, comfort, luxury,
              space and style, Riana Yachtâ€™s design & naval architecture boasts
              the highest commercial technical and safety standards as well as
              being profoundly fuel efficient with a cruising range of circa 800
              nautical miles at a cruise of circa 10 knots at an outstanding
              fuel burn of circa 75 liters per hour inclusive of generators.
            </p>
            <p>Fuel consumption varies based on weather and sea conditions.</p>
