              <p>
                Launched in 2009 and fully refitted in 2022, Riana is a
                custom-built 42-meter, 220-ton luxury sailing yacht with the
                elegance & grace of the traditional sailing yachts of yesteryear
                but with all the modern amenities one may expect.

              <h3>FUEL EFFICIENCY = SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
              <p>
                Riana Yacht is in the top 30% (by LOA) of all yachts in the
                world and arguably outperforms practically all others in its
                class & size with its combination of cruising speed vs.
                efficiency vs. economy vs. comfort and volume.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exuding quality, comfort, luxury, space and style, Riana Yachtâ€™s
                design & naval architecture boasts the highest commercial
                technical and safety standards as well as being profoundly fuel
                efficient with a cruising range of circa 800 nautical miles at a
                cruise of circa 10 knots at an outstanding fuel burn of circa 75
                litres per hour inclusive of generators.
              </p>

                Fuel consumption varies based on weather and sea conditions.
